 * Train that accepts collections instead of individual elements.
 *
 * <p>This class may be useful when you need to add many elements
 * to a train and don't want to do this with a sequence of calls to
 * {@link Train#with(Object)}. The following code will add many
 * XSL shifts from classpath to a train:</p>
 *
 * <pre> Train&lt;String&gt; empty = new TrClasspath&lt;&gt;(new TrDefault&lt;&gt;());
 * Train&lt;Shift&gt; full = new TrBulk&lt;&gt;(empty).with(
 *   Arrays.asList(
 *     "/foo/test/first.xsl",
 *     "/foo/test/second.xsl",
 *   )
 * ).back();</pre>
 *
 * <p>Here, the method {@link Train.Temporary#back()} is used to get the
 * train which was extended with shifts by {@link TrBulk}. In the example
 * above, {@code full} train will be a {@link Train} of {@link Shift}
 * objects.</p>
